*Shibboleth* by Doris Salcedo was a £300,000\[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth*(artwork)#cite_note-1) [installation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_art), the eighth commission in the "Unilever Series" (sponsored by [Unilever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilever)), which takes place annually in the Turbine Hall, the main entrance lobby of [Tate Modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tate_Modern)
 in London.  Salcedo's installation took the form of a 548-foot 
(167-metre) long, meandering crack in the floor of the Turbine Hall, a 
hairline crack at one end which expanded to a few inches of width and 
around two feet of depth at the other.\[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth*(artwork)#cite*note-alberge-2)  The crack was made by opening up the floor and then inserting a cast from a Colombian rock face.\[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth*(artwork)#cite*note-alberge-2)
 A Tate spokesperson said, "She’s not specifying how it’s been done. 
What she wants is for people to think about what’s real and what’s not."\[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth*(artwork)#cite_note-alberge-2)

**Salcedo said of the work:**

> It represents borders, the 
> experience of immigrants, the experience of segregation, the experience 
> of racial hatred. It is the experience of a Third World person coming 
> into the heart of Europe. For example, the space which illegal 
> immigrants occupy is a negative space. And so this piece is a negative 
> space.\[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth_(artwork)#cite_note-alberge-2)

Tate Director Sir [Nicholas Serota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Serota)
 stated, "There is a crack, there is a line, and eventually there will 
be a scar. It will remain as a memory of the work and also as a memorial
 to the issues Doris touches on."\[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth_(artwork)#cite_note-alberge-2)
 The exhibition took place from 9 October 2007 to 6 April 2008. 
Following the exhibition the crack was filled in, leaving a visible line
 in the floor.

Engineer Stuart Smith, who was responsible for the realisation 
and installation of the artwork, has since revealed that it was achieved
 by casting new concrete on top of the original floor slab.\[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth_(artwork)#cite_note-nice-3)

The work has gained the nickname "Doris's crack".\[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth_(artwork)#cite_note-4)
